    "\n",
    "Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning to improve the performance of a model by reducing variance, bias, or both. The key reasons for using ensemble techniques include:\n",
    "- **Improved accuracy**: By combining different models, the ensemble model can correct for the errors of individual models.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Ensembles are less likely to overfit compared to single models.\n",
    "- **Stability**: It makes the model less sensitive to noise in the training data.\n",

    "**Bagging** (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique where multiple models (typically decision trees) are trained independently on different random subsets of the training data. These subsets are created using **bootstrapping**, a method of sampling with replacement. The predictions of all models are then aggregated (e.g., through voting for classification or averaging for regression).\n",
